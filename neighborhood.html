        <h2>What it's like</h2>
        <p>
            I live in the Marmalade district in Salt Lake City and it's a very nice place to live. We are right next to capitol hill and have the same feel as such.
            There are trees on all streets that overhang you as you drive on the road. The people here are generally very friendly and have healthy lifestyles.
            You will see many people out for a run or walking their dogs with smiles on their faces. We're just a mile walk from downtown and all the great things that has
            to offer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall it's a very lovely community!
